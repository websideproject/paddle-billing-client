Python wrapper around the new Paddle Billing API

</div>

## Paddle Classic vs Paddle Billing

- Paddle Classic is the original Paddle API, which is still in use by many merchants. More info can be found [here](https://developer.paddle.com/classic/api-reference/1384a288aca7a-api-reference)
  - If you are looking for the Paddle Classic API wrapper, please see [paddle-client](https://github.com/paddle-python/paddle-client)
- Paddle Billing is the new API, which is just launched at 2023, August. Paddle Billing is a complete rewrite of the Paddle Classic API, and is designed to be more flexible and easier to use. More info can be found [here](https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/overview)

### Django Integration
- For Paddle Classic, there is a Django integration available at [dj-paddle](https://github.com/paddle-python/dj-paddle) and [django-paddle](https://github.com/kennell/django-paddle)
- For Paddle Billing, there is a Work In Progress Django integration available at (TBD)

poetry add paddle-billing-client
```

## Usage

```python
client = PaddleApiClient(
    base_url="https://sandbox-api.paddle.com/", 
    authentication_method=HeaderAuthentication(token="your-paddle-token")
)

# Create a product
product = client.create_product(
            ProductRequest(
                name="Test Product New",
                tax_category="standard",
                description="Test Product Description",
                image_url="https://example.com/image.png",
                custom_data=dict(foo="bar"),
            )
        )
                         
# Get all products
products = client.products.get_products()

# Get all plans
plans = client.plans.get_plans()
```
- Sandbox API url: `https://sandbox-api.paddle.com/`
- Live API url: `https://api.paddle.com/`

More usage examples can be found in **tests**.

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/WebstormitDev/paddle-billing-client/blob/main/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` and `darglint` library

Update all dev libraries to the latest version using one comand

```bash
make update-dev-deps
```

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/WebstormitDev/paddle-billing-client/tree/main/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
make dsstore-remove
```

Remove .mypycache

```bash
make mypycache-remove
```

Or to remove all above run:

```bash
make cleanup
```

</p>
</details>

## 📈 Releases

You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/WebstormitDev/paddle-billing-client/releases) page.

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

We use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you’re ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.

### List of labels and corresponding titles

|               **Label**               |  **Title in Releases**  |
| :-----------------------------------: | :---------------------: |
|       `enhancement`, `feature`        |       🚀 Features       |
| `bug`, `refactoring`, `bugfix`, `fix` | 🔧 Fixes & Refactoring  |
|       `build`, `ci`, `testing`        | 📦 Build System & CI/CD |
|              `breaking`               |   💥 Breaking Changes   |
|            `documentation`            |    📝 Documentation     |
|            `dependencies`             | ⬆️ Dependencies updates |

You can update it in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/WebstormitDev/paddle-billing-client/blob/main/.github/release-drafter.yml).

GitHub creates the `bug`, `enhancement`, and `documentation` labels for you. Dependabot creates the `dependencies` label. Create the remaining labels on the Issues tab of your GitHub repository, when you need them.

### Building and releasing your package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish 🙂 `poetry publish --build`
