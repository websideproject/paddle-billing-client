Notifications object

Notification entities describe a notification for an event that happened in your Paddle system.

You can get notifications for

When an event that you have a notification destination for occurs, Paddle creates a notification entity with information about the notification.

Notification entities hold information like:

The event, including new or changed entity.

Keep in mind that a single event might create multiple notifications. This is common when working with multiple notification destinations that are subscribed to the same events. When an event occurs, Paddle creates a separate related notification entity for each notification destination. They'll share the same

event_id

, but have different a

notification_id

.
