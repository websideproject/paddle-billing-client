Reports

Report object

Report entities describe a report that was generated in your Paddle system.

Reports are a way of exporting data from your Paddle system for further analysis or manipulation. You can choose from a selection of reports, and filter the data that's included on them.

Report entities hold information like:

What kind of report it is.

How the data on the report was filtered.

How many records are on the report.

Whether the report is ready to download, or if it's still processing.

Report entities don't hold report data themselves. They describe the criteria used to generate a report.

After Paddle has finished generating a report, you can use the Paddle ID of a report to get a download link for a CSV file that includes your report data.
