Transactions

Transaction object

Transaction entities calculate and capture revenue. They hold information about a customer purchase.

Transactions are at the heart of Paddle. They tie together

.

Paddle automatically creates transactions when customers sign up using the checkout, as well as when subscription lifecycle events like renewals or

happen.

You can also create a transaction through the Paddle dashboard or the API. You can

Transactions hold information like:

Who the customer is.

Which items they're purchasing.

Calculated totals for the customer and items.

Any payment attempts.

Transactions handle all parts of revenue calculation, including complex

,

, and tax calculations.

Paddle returns calculated totals for a transaction in the

details

object. Details are the single source for totals on a transaction. They're used for collecting payment from a customer and revenue recognition.

Though the terms "transaction" and "payment" are sometimes used interchangeably, they're distinct entities in Paddle:

Transactions

calculate and captures revenue, ready for payment

Payments

Transactions can have more than one payment against them. For example, customers paying for larger value deals by invoice might make multiple payments, and automatically collected payments might fail.

For pricing pages and other screens that let customers preview changes to their subscription, you can

rather than creating it.

When previewing a transaction, you don't need to send the same information as you would if you were creating it.

Transactions are financial records. They can't be deleted, and they can't be changed once they've been billed.
